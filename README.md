## About The Project

Climactic is a system that lets you monitor real time environmental data from "stations" anywhere on your network as well as visualize historical data and statistics.

### Stations

Stations are network enabled devices that provide environmental data.

You can have as many stations as you want and assign them names.

Stations currently measure 3 different environmental data

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
